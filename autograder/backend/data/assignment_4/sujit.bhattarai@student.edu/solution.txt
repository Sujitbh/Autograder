# Start coding here...The "Submit Assignment" button is failing with the error "Failed to submit assignment."
Please debug and fix the frontend submission logic.

Ensure that:

The correct API endpoint for assignment submission is being called.

The request method, headers, and authentication token are included properly.

The assignment ID and submission data (code, files, or text) are correctly passed in the request body.

Proper error handling is implemented to display backend error messages.

Add console logs to help trace submission failures.

Ensure the UI updates correctly after successful submission.
